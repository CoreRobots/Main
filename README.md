# 2D Retro Game Ecosystem: Integrating LLMs, AI Agents, and $CORE  
  
### Overview   

CoreRobots introduces a 2D Gameboy/Nintendo-style game. Inspired by beloved titles from this legendary era, such as *Pokemon* and *The Legend of Zelda*, the game aims to capture the pixel-perfect simplicity, chiptune melodies, and emotionally engaging narratives that defined a generation of gaming. Featuring $CORE as the foundation of its in-game economy, and LLM generated dialogues, the game blends retro aesthetics with the innovation of AI and Web3. 

By merging the artistry of the past with the tools of the future, CoreRobots aspires to create a game that feels both familiar and revolutionary.  

Expect:  
- Pixel-art graphics capturing the charm of 8-bit sprites.  
- Chiptune music to evoke the nostalgia of vintage soundtracks.  
- A vibrant overworld filled with towns, dungeons, and mysteries that harken back to the golden age of gaming.

## Core Concepts  
Players explore a retro-styled, pixel-art world filled with procedurally-generated characters, quests, and narratives.  

- **LLMs** generate dialogue tailored to each agents personality.  
- **AI agents** provide distinct personalities for non-playable characters (NPCs).  
- **$CORE cryptocurrency** powers the economy for transactions and in-game assets.

## Technical Framework  

### AI-Powered NPCs  
Each NPC is tailored by an AI agent configured with:  
- **Archetype Traits:** Governs their overall behavioral archetype (e.g., "grumpy merchant," "wise sage").    
- **Social Persona Modeling:** AI agents are shaped by analyzing real-world activity, aligning each NPC's dialogues with its corresponding human communication patterns.  

*Example:*  
A NPC based off Elon Musk will have its dialogues trained from Elon Musk.  

### Procedural Dialogue via LLMs  
The LLM generates lore-consistent dialogue based on:  
- Game state data  
- NPC personality profiles  

## **Launch Mechanics and $CORE Integration**

### **Snapshot and Game Access**  
- A **snapshot** of $CORE token holders will be taken approximately **6-12 hours after the official launch**.  
- All wallet addresses included in the snapshot will gain immediate access to the game and its features.  
- Players will be able to **connect their wallets**, enabling in-game utilization of $CORE for transactions, upgrades, and other interactive elements.  

### **Token Mechanics**  
- **Deflationary System:**  
  - Every $CORE token spent in-game will be either **burned** (permanently removed from circulation) or **locked** indefinitely, ensuring a deflationary model that increases the long-term value of $CORE.  

- **Earning $CORE:**  
  - Players can earn $CORE tokens by completing **main storyline missions**.

In summary this game aims to redefine gaming by combining LLMs, AI agents, and blockchain technology within a nostalgic 2D retro framework. By leveraging $CORE cryptocurrency for economic mechanics, the platform offers a scalable, engaging experience that empowers players through emergent storytelling and decentralized ownership.
